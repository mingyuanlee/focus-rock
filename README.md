### Forewords: What's Goal Forest

What the f**k am I doing? - That's the question I ask myself everyday. When I'm not sure where I'm investing the time and effort, I'm trapped in a random status doing nothing, which eventually leads to frustration - because I have wasted a day in my life.<br />

I had enough frustration, so I decided to use my time wisely. I realized that my current status actually comes from two things: decision and effort. When I feel good, it's usually because I made several great decisions and put the effort on the right things. When I feel bad, it's usually because of the opposite. Decisions are a another bunch of stuff, I'm focusing on efforts here.<br />

How do you make solid efforts? Tons of dust don't make a building, they need a structure. I need to make sure my hardworks don't become tons of dust as the time moves. So I need some forms of structure. I designed two of them, one is stream, the other is epoch. A stream is a collections of epochs, and each epoch is a period of time assigned with a specific goal. Learning French can be a stream, preparing for TCF test can be a stage, and finishing each listening practice chapter can be an epoch. During each epoch, I don't think about or do anything irrelevant to the goal. If I can't focus, I'll stop and restore to the right status. 
<br />

I developed this tool to keep track of my time usage. I can then understand how many hours of my life have been converted to epochs and how many hours have been wasted, what goals have I completed, and what streams is my life distributed on.
