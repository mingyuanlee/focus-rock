What the f**k am I doing? - That's the question I ask myself everyday. <br />

When I'm not sure where I'm investing the time and effort, I'm trapped in a status of doing nothing, which eventually leads to frustration - because I have wasted a day in my life.<br />

I had enough frustration, so I decided to use my time wisely. I want to see what I did in the past week and how much time I contributed to each topic. <br />

The philosophy behind this tool: I divide my lifetime into streams, for example, learning French, doing research and etc. Then I divide each stream into partitions, they are like a stage in each stream, for example, pass the TEF French Test. Finally I divide partitions into epochs, where I finish or not finish some task (e.g. learning section 1 grammar) in a specific range of time. I keep track of these things and update them freely in the app. <br />
